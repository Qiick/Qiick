# I'm Brian or Qiick
I'm a somebody on the internet that wants to become a Software Developer.
On this moment in understand a lot of things, but i'm still learning. 

## What can i do?
I'm fearly well at using Caddywebserver, Ubuntu Server and Nginx. 
I know how to use Pterodactyl, and how to set it up properly and integrade it with Blesta and WHMCS.
And i'm trying to teach myself HTML, CSS and JavaScript.


## My tools.
I use mostly VS Code, it's free and it's a usefull tool. I use it mostly to connect to Dedicated servers and multiple VPS's to edit the code, customize the Pterodactyl panel, change the Nginx settings and implemeting SSL certificates. 

I use cloudflare for my domain, because of the Proxy function. It's a handy tool to easly hide the ip-adress of an server. And setting up DNS records and making SSL certificates.
